Steps To run the project --> 

Step 1 -> After cloning the application run 'npm i' to install all the dependencies
Step 2 -> Run 'npm run dev' to run the application

(please start backend to successfully login into the application)

Valid credentials are
    Email -> mtnuser@gmail.com
    Password -> MTN281#^@*


"What to improve" -> We can have the strong passwod validation like Combination of special character, Capital letter, alphanumeric value. We can have forget password and remember password functionality. We can also give user a CAPTHA functionality where we can check only human can login into the system. We can make application responsive, so that it can work on mobile tablet or on different screen sizes.We can make use of jwt token received from backend to check the person is login or not and can autherize based on it. We can make use of interceptor to call add the headers or auth token received from the backend to call the api as well as to transform the data received from the backend. We can make use of notification library to show success or failure notification to user whether he is login successfully or not.
